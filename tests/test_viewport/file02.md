# Test File 02

This is the second test file for verifying the explorer viewport calculation fix.

## Features

- Multiple markdown files
- Testing viewport scrolling
- Ensuring all files are visible

## Details

This file helps verify that the viewport calculation bug has been fixed and that all files in the directory are now visible in the file explorer, not just the last 3 files.

The previous issue was caused by incorrect viewport positioning calculations that made the first entries render outside the visible bounds.
